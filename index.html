      <p class="lead">ntroducton to Yoga:
          Yoga is a physical workout that improves muscle tone, circulation, flexibility, posture, and balance. But it’s also a mental exercise, helping you to chill, energize, and manage stress. It helps you build and maintain muscle, joint, and organ health, as well as reduce your risk of conditions like diabetes and heart disease. The relaxation techniques used in yoga can lessen chronic pain, such as lower back pain, arthritis, headaches and carpal tunnel syndrome.
          Mental benefits
          Aside from the physical benefits, one of the best benefits of yoga is how it helps a person manage stress, which is known to have devastating effects on the body and mind. “Stress can reveal itself in many ways, including back or neck pain, sleeping problems, headaches, drug abuse, and an inability to concentrate,” says Dr. Nevins. “Yoga can be very effective in developing coping skills and reaching a more positive outlook on life.”
          Meditation
          Yoga’s incorporation of meditation and breathing can help improve a person’s mental well-being. “Regular yoga practice creates mental clarity and calmness; increases body awareness; relieves chronic stress patterns; relaxes the mind; centers attention; and sharpens concentration,” says Dr. Nevins. Body- and self-awareness are particularly beneficial, she adds, “because they can help with early detection of physical problems and allow for early preventive action.”
          Strength
          Active, dynamic styles of yoga are great for strength training. They can be seen as the equivalent to doing a lot of reps of body-weight exercises. Ashtanga, with its emphasis on daily practice, many vinyasas, and mastery of postures in sequence is one of the most effective. Many types of Power Yoga, which are based on Ashtanga principles, also live up to their name. Rocket Yoga is another particularly strong style of practice, as is Jivamukti. Both of these incorporate lots of balancing and inverted postures within fast-paced flows.</p>
